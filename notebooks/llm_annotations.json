        "content": "Nostoc, a genus within the Nostocaceae, thrives in nutrient-limited freshwater, terrestrial, or symbiotic environments. These Cyanobacteria perform oxygenic photosynthesis and are notable for nitrogen fixation. Their enriched nitrogenase genes include both molybdenum- and vanadium-dependent enzymes, equipping them to convert inert atmospheric N\u2082 into bioavailable ammonia, especially under low-nitrogen conditions. This metabolic versatility supports growth in diverse ecosystems, contributing to nitrogen cycling and soil fertility. Their ability to balance photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation\u2014often via specialized heterocyst cells\u2014reflects adaptation to fluctuating environmental oxygen and nutrient levels.",
