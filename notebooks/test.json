        "content": "Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic prokaryotes that inhabit diverse environments, from freshwater to marine ecosystems and terrestrial soils. They play a crucial role in oxygen production and global carbon cycles, having contributed to the early oxygenation of Earth\u2019s atmosphere. These microorganisms exhibit a remarkable ability for adaptation, resisting harsh environmental conditions including high temperatures and UV exposure. Cyanobacteria form complex communities such as stromatolites, acting as ecological engineers. They produce bioactive compounds with potential pharmaceutical applications. Some species can create harmful algal blooms, impacting water quality and marine life. Their evolutionary history provides insights into microbial evolution and symbiotic relationships. Globally distributed.",
